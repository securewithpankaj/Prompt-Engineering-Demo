# AI Tools Catalog via Prompt Engineering

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of **prompt engineering** to generate a detailed and structured catalog of AI tools. Using a carefully crafted prompt, we obtained a comprehensive table listing 100 popular AI tools categorized by their use case, alongside their paid and free alternatives.

The main prompt used was:

> *"Act like you have years of experience of AI. I want you to make a table which has 3 columns and in the first column there should be the name of the work like AI image generator, AI video generator etc. In the second column there should be the name of the paid AI website and in the third column there should be the name of the free AI. This table should have 100 rows."*

## Purpose

- Showcase how prompt engineering can be used to extract structured and actionable information from AI models.
- Provide a valuable resource listing 100 AI tools across different categories.
- Help users quickly find paid and free AI services for their specific needs.

| AI Work Name          | Paid AI Website          | Free AI Tool              |
|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| AI Image Generator    | Midjourney              | Craiyon                   |
| AI Video Generator    | Synthesia               | Pictory (Free Plan)       |
| AI Text Generator     | Jasper AI               | ChatGPT Free              |
| AI Chatbot           | ChatGPT Plus             | Google Bard               |
| AI Coding Assistant   | GitHub Copilot          | Codeium                   |
| ...                  | ...                     | ...                       |
| (Total 100 rows)     |                         |                           |

## How This Works

1. **Prompt Engineering**: The carefully designed prompt guides the AI to produce exactly the format and data needed.
2. **AI Model Response**: The AI generates the table of AI tools categorized by function with paid and free options.
3. **Result Curation**: The output is formatted and saved into markdown files for easy access and use.
